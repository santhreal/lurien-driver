//! Runtime stealth-surface probe + drift detector.
//!
//! [`crate::browser::apply_stealth`] injects JS overrides (the source is
//! [`crate::fingerprint::profile_js`]). That injection is a STATIC contract - it
//! asserts the override is present in the source. It does NOT verify that the
//! override WORKS at runtime: another script may have re-defined the property;
//! the browser build may not expose it at all; or the patched value may drift
//! from "looks like real Firefox."
//!
//! `StealthProbe` answers "does the page actually pass the
//! fingerprint tests" by probing 100+ live surfaces and comparing
//! against expected real-browser values. The output is a structured
//! drift report - for each probed surface, the report carries
//! `(expected, actual, severity)`. Callers run this in dev to
//! verify a stealth-profile change still passes; CI runs it
//! against a synthetic-page fixture to catch regressions where a
//! profile update accidentally drops a surface.
//!
//! No public captcha-solver crate ships a comparable runtime
//! drift detector. The closest prior art is the OSS
//! `creep-js` browser-side fingerprint disclosure tool - but
//! creep-js is a JS library a human runs in a browser, not a
//! Rust-side automated probe.
//!
//! The concrete data types ([`Probe`], [`ProbeOutcome`], [`Severity`],
//! [`Capture`], [`DifferentialReport`], …) live in the `guise-oracle`
//! contract crate so downstream consumers can share the taxonomy without
//! pulling in a browser driver. This module owns the runtime evaluation and
//! rendering logic.
