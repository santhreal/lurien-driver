//! Wire-fingerprint **cluster membership**: the anti-uniqueness self-check
//! (G048–G051).
//!
//! A spoofed TLS/HTTP-2 fingerprint that is *byte-perfect Firefox* still loses
//! if it is the **only** client on the internet emitting that exact shape: a
//! unique fingerprint is itself a stable identifier (it tracks you across
//! sessions even with cookies cleared). The defense is not "look like a
//! browser" but "look like a **populated** browser cluster", collide with the
//! JA4/Akamai that millions of real users share.
//!
//! This module measures exactly that, and **only** that. Given a fingerprint
//! the caller's own stack emits (recovered from a probe such as
//! `tls.peet.ws/api/all`), it reports which known real-browser
//! [`FingerprintTarget`](crate::fingerprint::tls_targets::FingerprintTarget)s
//! that shape collides with. It is a screwdriver: it transforms *the caller's
//! own emitted fingerprint* into a membership verdict. It never inspects a
//! remote target, never claims a vulnerability, and never scores anyone.
//!
//! ## Soundness, what [`ClusterVerdict::Distinguishable`] does and does not mean
//!
//! A `Distinguishable` verdict means "this shape matched **no entry in the
//! bundled catalogue** on the primary axis." That is a fact about *catalogue
//! coverage*, **not** proof the fingerprint is globally unique, the catalogue
//! is a finite snapshot of published targets, and the real cluster a shape
//! belongs to may simply not be bundled yet. So `Distinguishable` lowers the
//! caller's confidence that they blend in; it never raises a claim that the
//! fingerprint is trackable in the wild. Closing the gap is "add the measured
//! target," never "assert uniqueness."
//!
//! ## Why JA4 is the primary axis, Akamai-H2 the corroborator
//!
//! - **JA4** sorts the GREASE-stripped cipher and extension lists before
//!   hashing (FoxIO spec; see [`compute_ja4`](crate::fingerprint::ja3::compute_ja4)),
//!   so it is *stable across handshakes*, unlike a raw ClientHello capture
//!   whose GREASE values and positions vary every connection. A stable surface
//!   is the only kind a cluster can be defined over, so JA4 is the **required**
//!   axis: membership is asserted only when JA4 matches.
//! - **Akamai HTTP/2** (`SETTINGS|WINDOW_UPDATE|PRIORITY|header-order`) is set
//!   by the engine's networking stack, not JavaScript. It *corroborates*: a JA4
//!   that matches Firefox while the H2 frame says something else is an
//!   incoherent shape, so a **probed** Akamai that contradicts the JA4 match
//!   breaks membership rather than being silently ignored. When it contradicts,
//!   parse both sides with
//!   [`akamai_h2::AkamaiH2Fingerprint`](crate::fingerprint::akamai_h2) and
//!   [`diff`](crate::fingerprint::akamai_h2::AkamaiH2Fingerprint::diff) them to
//!   localize the divergence to the exact frame field (which SETTINGS value,
//!   pseudo-header order, …) (the surface here is a coarse Matched/Mismatched).
//! - **JA3** is order-sensitive and deprecated; **peetprint** is a `peet.ws`
//!   composite. Both are recorded and, when probed, may contradict, but neither
//!   alone establishes membership.
//!
//! Every surface is tri-state ([`SurfaceMatch`]): `Matched`, `Mismatched`, or
//! `NotProbed`. Collapsing "not probed" into "mismatched" would silently turn an
//! un-probed surface into a false contradiction, so the distinction is kept
//! explicit end to end.
