//! Persona rarity scoring (G104).
//!
//! Anti-bot systems track visitors partly by how *unique* their fingerprint is.
//! A persona that no real user shares is a tell, even if every individual value
//! is "plausible". The rarity score estimates how common a shipped persona is
//! in the real world, so selection logic (G231) can prefer modal, populated
//! buckets over uncrowded ones.
//!
//! The score is a unitless 1-100 rank derived from public browser-market-share
//! data and the relative frequency of the OS/hardware combination. It is NOT a
//! precise population percentage; it is a stable ordinal for persona selection.
